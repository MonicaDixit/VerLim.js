First-time jQuery users can check out the [VerLim.js Beginner’s Guide](http://pranayjoshi.thoughts2share.in/verlim-js-beginners-guide/). Intermediate users can probably glean everything needed by view-source’ing the demos.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nVerLim is fully automatic, no configuration is necessary to get started.\r\n\r\n// Format:\r\n`$(window).VerLim();`\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to make some tweaks, here’s how:\r\n\r\n`samples: // passing some basic setting(s)`\r\n`$(window).VerLim(`\r\n    `{`\r\n        `color: \"#dd2266\",`\r\n        `autoHide: \"on\",`\r\n        `autoHideTime: \"2\",`\r\n        `theme: \"on\",`\r\n        `position: \"top\",`\r\n        `thickness: \"5px\",`\r\n        `shadow: \"on\"`\r\n    `});`\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\nactive : To disable the plug in effect set this setting as “off”, by default it’s “on” and progress bar will be visible\r\n\r\nautoHide : Sets the progress to be hidden after a default (2 seconds) or configure time.\r\n\r\nautoHideTime : Sets the time of the auto hide property, in seconds.\r\n\r\ncolor : This can be used to set color of progress bar, provide a valid RGB color code or valid color name (e.g. #FF0000 or red)\r\n\r\nposition : If top progress bar will be shown on the upper side of the screen, other option is “bottom”\r\n\r\nthickness : The thickness of progress bar, can be set in any format, if only number it will be px, other options are “5px”,  “5pt”,  “5%”, “5em”\r\n\r\ntheme : This allows the user to set theme to the progress bar, set this as “on” and add css (if no css found default will work see demo)\r\n\r\nshadow : If “on” provides a cool blue color shadow below progress bar using box shadow property.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Public Methods\r\n$(window).VerLim();  This method allows you to call VerLim without having to assign any configuration to it.\r\n\r\n## Themes\r\nVerLim.js currently includes two themes to get you started. Just include the appropriate css file.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nAs it’s a JQuery plug in; the only dependency is the earlier.\r\n\r\n## Support\r\nVerLim is designed to show progress bar on almost all modern mobile browser(s) ; also it support IE7+ (standards mode), FF 3.5+, Chrome, Safari 4+, Opera 10.5+.\r\n\r\n## Size\r\nVerLim.js is 2kb minified.
